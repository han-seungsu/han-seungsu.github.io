## Experience

**Research Intern @ Uncertainty Quantification Lab, SNU** (_2024.12 – Present_)  
- Advisor: Prof. Won Chang  
- Proposed a flexible variational inference method with stick-breaking mixture normalizing flows  
- Applied a tail-transformation flow with a new tail estimator, proving consistency and convergence guarantees  

**Research Intern @ Data Science & Machine Learning Lab, SNU** (_2024.06 – 2024.12_)  
- Advisor: Prof. Gunwoong Park  
- Developed a structure learning algorithm with optimal sample complexity for Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (LiNGAMs)  
- Conducted real-data analysis on the General Social Survey (GSS) using DAG learning algorithms
